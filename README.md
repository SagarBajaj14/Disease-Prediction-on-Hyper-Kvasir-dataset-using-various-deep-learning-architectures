# GastroDeep: Advancing Gastrointestinal Disease Detection with Deep Learning Models

Gastrointestinal disease detection is an important task in medical image analysis, and the Hyper-Kvasir dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset for this task. ResNet(Residual Network) is a deep learning architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks. This project utilizes deep learning models for the detection of gastrointestinal diseases using the Hyper-Kvasir dataset ( Link: https://datasets.simula.no/hyper-kvasir/). The dataset contains 10662 labeled images, 1000 segmented images, 99417 unlabeled images, and 373 videos of the gastrointestinal tract. The number of images per class are not balanced, which is a general challenge in the medical field due to the fact that some findings occur more often than others. This adds an additional challenge since methods applied to the data should also be able to learn from a small amount of training data. The labeled images represent 23 different classes of findings. The project pipeline includes data preprocessing, followed by fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN models. The CNN models including ResNet, DenseNet, VGG, EfficientNet, InceptionNet, and a custom CNN achieved an average accuracy of 90% on the image dataset while the same models achieved an average accuracy of 70% for the video classification task.
